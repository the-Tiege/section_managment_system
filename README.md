# Integrated Wearable Sensor System for Soldier Monitoring

## Overview

The Integrated Wearable Sensor System for Soldier Monitoring is a comprehensive project developed to enhance the monitoring capabilities of soldiers in the field. Leveraging C++ programming, this system seamlessly integrates a variety of sensors to track crucial parameters, including real-time location, ammunition expenditure, and vital signs such as heart rate.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor soldiers' locations in real-time, providing a live overview of their positions during operations.
- **Ammunition Expenditure:** Track ammunition usage, offering insights into resource management and mission planning.
- **Vital Sign Monitoring:** Continuously monitor vital signs such as heart rate to ensure the well-being of soldiers in dynamic environments.

## System Architecture

The wearable sensors collect data, which is then transmitted to a Flask server hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The server intelligently stores the information in an SQLite database for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## Web Interface

The collected data is presented to the user through a dynamic web interface, offering a detailed and accessible overview of the soldier's performance and well-being. This interface allows for quick decision-making and real-time assessment of the situation.

## Key Technologies Used

- **C++:** Proficiently utilized C++ programming for the development of the wearable sensor system.
- **Python:** Implement API using Python.
- **Flask:** Implemented a Flask server on a Raspberry Pi for data transmission and storage.
- **SQLite:** Employed SQLite for efficient and organized data storage.

## Purpose

This project not only demonstrates a high level of proficiency in C++ programming but also showcases the ability to integrate hardware components, providing a holistic solution for real-world scenarios. The Integrated Wearable Sensor System for Soldier Monitoring is designed to improve situational awareness and decision-making by providing comprehensive insights into the physical condition and location of soldiers during missions.
